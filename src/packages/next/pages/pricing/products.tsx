            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>
              Your work on <span>CoCalc</span> happens inside one or more{" "}
              <A href="https://doc.cocalc.com/project.html">projects</A>. They
              form your personal workspaces, where you privately store your
              files, computational worksheets, and data. You typically run
              computations through a web browser, either via a{" "}

            <h2>Shared Resources</h2>
            <p>
              Each project runs on a server, where it shares disk space, CPU,
              and RAM with other projects. Initially, you work in a{" "}
              <A href="https://doc.cocalc.com/trial.html">trial project</A>,
              which runs with default quotas on heavily used machines that are
              rebooted frequently. Upgrading to "member hosting" moves your
              project to a machine with higher-quality hosting and less
              competition for resources.
            </p>

            <h2>Upgrading Projects</h2>
            <p>
              By purchasing one or more of our subscriptions or plans, you
              receive a certain amount of{" "}
              <A href="https://doc.cocalc.com/billing.html#quota-upgrades">
                quota upgrades
              </A>
              . Use these upgrades to improve hosting quality, enable internet
              access from within a project or increase quotas for CPU and RAM in
              order to work on larger problems and do more computations
              simultaneously. On top of that, your{" "}
              <A href="mailto:help@cocalc.com">support questions</A> are
              prioritized.
            </p>
            <p>
              All project collaborators <em>collectively contribute</em> to the
              same project â€” their contributions benefit all project
              collaborators equally.
            </p>

            <br />
            <h2>License Keys</h2>
            <p>
              <A href="https://doc.cocalc.com/licenses.html">License Keys</A>{" "}
              are applied to projects. One license key can upgrade up to a
              certain number of <b>simultaneously running projects</b> with the
              given upgrade schema. You can apply a single license key to an
              unlimited number of projects.

                  Upgrade schema per project: a small 1 GB memory / 1 shared CPU
                  upgrade is fine for basic calculations, but we find that many
                  data and computational science projects run better with
                  additional RAM and CPU.
