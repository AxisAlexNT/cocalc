              Are you looking for something beyond a terminal or editing shell
              scripts? CoCalc also offers{" "}

              .
            </p>
            <p>
              This is similar to working with a terminal, but it saves all the
              input you typed and the corresponding output in "cells". That
              helps you with learning Linux commands, because it makes it easier
              to edit the code input or compare different outcomes of similar
              code. Besides that, you can also take notes between code cells.

              Everything runs remotely on CoCalc's servers. This means you do

              setup and installation issues yourself, or fear losing or
              corrupting files on your computer.
