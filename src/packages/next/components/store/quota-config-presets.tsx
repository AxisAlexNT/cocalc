        collecting files from many students adds up – hence the disk quota is
        increased significantly! Finally, a longer idle-timeout will allow you
        to make longer breaks without your project being shut down. You only
        need a license with a "Run Limit" of one for your instructor project.
        Apply that license via the{" "}

        This configuration allows the project to run many Jupyter Notebooks and
        Worksheets at once or run computations that require plenty of memory. An
        idle-timeout of one day is sufficient to not interrupt your work and you
        can also run calculations, which take a while to complete. Increasing
        the disk space quota allows you to store larger datasets as well. If you
