/*
Purchase everything that is checked and in the shopping cart.

This API endpoint gets called when user has confirmed their payment
method and clicked the button to complete the purchase.

Of course this doesn't take any input, since the contents of the cart
is already in the database, and the card info (and which is the default)
is in stripe only.

If this successfully runs, then the checked items in the shopping
cart are changed in the database so that the purchased field is set.
