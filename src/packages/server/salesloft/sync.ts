/*
Given an array of any size of cocalc account_id's, create or update corresponding
salesloft people.

Salesloft has a hard requirement that a person has an email address or phone
number. We don't have phone numbers in cocalc, so if a cocalc account has no email
address, then we just skip it.

We include or update the following information about each person:

- email_address
- first_name
- last_name

THESE ARE NOT used at all yet, since they must be configured from the web interface as explained here:
https://help.salesloft.com/s/article/Person-Field-Configuration#Add_Custom_Person_Field

- custom_fields:
  - cocalc_account_id: the cocalc account_id
  - cocalc_created: date when cocalc account was created (UTC timestamp)
  - cocalc_last_active: date when cocalc account was last active (UTC timestamp)
  - stripe_customer_id: if they interacted with our payment system, they will have a stripe id
  - cocalc_tags: if they entered tags when creating their account
  - cocalc_notes: if we typed in notes about them via our CRM

Later, we will also try to provide more interesting information.  But this should be something
to get started.
