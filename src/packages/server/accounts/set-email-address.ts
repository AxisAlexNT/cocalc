/*
Set email address of an account.

The password must also be provided. If the email address is already set in the
database, then password has to be the current correct password. If the email
address is NOT set, then a new email address and password are set.

Also, if user changes email address to one that has some pending actions, carry
those actions out.  (TODO: should probably only do these after email address
is verified.)

Throws an exception if something is wrong.
